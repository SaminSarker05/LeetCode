- sliding window 0(n)

- dealing with contiguous array of data
- fixed sliding window and dynamic sliding window
  - fixed: shifting entire window
  - dynamic: shrinking and expanding window to meet solution

- stoping criteria is end of data structure
- BETTER THAN N^2 naive brute foce method of generating all possible combinations
